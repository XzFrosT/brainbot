I'm creating this bot as my learning curve, so i learn things then try to implement something with it and yeah this bot is my playground XD, Also to enhance UX, I have planned some features for this bot, and also some refactoring to current features.
The following list is based on the current Brainbot version 4 (first written on 23 December 2022), And here's the on-going plans for Brainbot version 4:
- [x] Create API server to handle http interaction
- [x] Rewrite the bot in C++ (using DPP library)
- [x] New Chat System
- [x] Add ai image-to-image generation
- [x] Deploy the new Brain Bot v4 to production (approximately on the bot birthday, 6 January 2024)
- [x] Optimize the interaction Collector (the current one is too slow i guess, based on help command)
- [ ] Make the chat proxy become self-modifying for easier deployment
- [ ] Add TavernAI (probably based on character.ai)
- [ ] Optimize the API, like it's response time (Probably I'll rewrite it on another framework or language, like rust? i guess)
- [ ] Proxy microservices

i might not implement them in orderðŸ˜…, depends on my mood haha
